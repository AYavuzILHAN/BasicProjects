She vehemently refuses to be with Adam. When Adam insists, she escapes with magic and leaves him. The angels find her to bring him back, but she informs them that there are more than 100 jinn children because she is with Samael, so she can no longer be faithful to Adam. Meanwhile, God sends three angels to stop her. The angels tell her that if she does not return, they will kill one of her children every day, and if she does not return and obey God and Adam, they will kill one of her children for every day he disobeys. Thereupon, she begins to kill the children of those descended from Adam and Eve. According to the tradition, she tries to kill men within 8 days of birth and girls within 20 days. The jinns believed to exist in the world today are said to have originated from the union of Adam and his sister Naama and Tuval Cain. Before Adam and Eve were cursed with limited life before leaving paradise, they were immortal. After that, God creates another wife whose name is unknown, and Adam watches this creation. He is very affected by what he sees and does not accept the new wife. Thirdly, he later puts Adam to sleep and creates Eve from his rib bone. Eve, being created from a part of Adam, is subject to him.\n\n!!!Please write your answers in lowercase letters, otherwise the system will perceive them as wrong even if you guess correctly.!!!\n\nThird word")
